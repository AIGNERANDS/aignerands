Hi! I’m currently transitioning into tech, building on a strong foundation in product quality, workflows, and user experience. I’m focused on developing the technical skills that will allow me to bridge the gap between great ideas and great execution.

What I'm working on:

📚 Growing my skills in software testing, QA, and tech workflows

🛠️ Building a toolkit for creating polished, user-centered products

🤝 Collaborating, learning, and contributing to real-world projects

🚀 Laying the groundwork for a career at the intersection of quality and innovation
